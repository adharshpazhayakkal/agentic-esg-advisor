Internal Policy and Responsibility Framework

Operational responsibilities are assigned to department supervisors to ensure smooth
functioning of daily activities. Environmental and safety-related matters are generally
handled by the operations team as part of their routine duties.

There is no dedicated ESG or sustainability officer at present. Compliance-related
tasks are addressed on an as-needed basis depending on operational requirements.

Employees are encouraged to follow basic cleanliness and safety practices within
their work areas. Training related to waste handling and safety is provided informally
during onboarding or through verbal instructions.
