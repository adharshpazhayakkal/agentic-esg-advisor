Waste Management Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)

The organization generates multiple categories of waste during daily operations,
including packaging materials, plastic scrap, electronic waste from damaged equipment,
and limited organic waste from employee facilities.

Waste is collected at designated points within the facility at the end of each shift.
General waste is stored in closed containers to prevent spillage and odor issues.

Plastic and electronic waste are separated informally by maintenance staff before
temporary storage. Hazardous waste generation is minimal and primarily limited to
used batteries and electronic components.

Waste disposal is handled periodically through third-party vendors. Disposal records
are maintained by the operations team when available.

At present, there is no formal documentation defining waste segregation categories
or color-coded bins across all departments.
