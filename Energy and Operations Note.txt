Energy and Operations Note

The facility primarily operates using grid electricity for production and office
activities. Due to occasional power interruptions, a diesel generator is used as a
backup energy source to ensure continuity of operations.

Energy consumption is monitored through monthly electricity bills. No automated
energy monitoring systems are currently in place.

Basic practices such as switching off idle equipment and lighting are encouraged
by supervisors, though there is no formal energy efficiency policy.

Fuel usage for the diesel generator is recorded during procurement and maintenance
activities. Renewable energy sources are currently not utilized.
